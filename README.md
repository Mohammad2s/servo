## Description
The five servo motors were codded in two different ways, first code was to move each servo motor from 0 degree to 90 degrees automatically as it's codded in Arduino. But the second one is to move one of the five servo motor by the potentiometer as the user would like to move. In the two tasks, all servo motors were designed to moves between 0 degree and 90 degree
